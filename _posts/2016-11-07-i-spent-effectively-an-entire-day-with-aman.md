I spent effectively an entire day with Aman from Ministry. Any day this is true is a good day for me.

First in a meeting with Macerich's real estate team which Aman asked me to attend then with Art from Macerich. Later in the day we met up with the Japanese soccer superstar Keisuke Honda's business manager (based in SD). Keisuke is a recent investor in Ministry and I've worked with him a few times since (he invited all of us to a soccer game once but too late to make it.)

To say that Macerich is motivated to make a big statement with Ministry is an understatement. As a reminder, we made the intro a few months ago with no expectations on investment.

Since then Macerich has offered a few things they don't typically offer a young company, namely complete buildout coverage for 6-10 stores nationally under a variable rent (20%) three year term. This is more attractive than any retail company would normally see.

And Macerich is about to make a $5M investment in the company.

One of the things I loved about the conversation was Art's realistic view that while Macerich properties are right for some locations, not all locations are right for Ministry.

A majority of our time was spent discussing the potential locations and how they fit with our acquisition strategy. And we identified 1-2 locations that will serve as a market test for Ministry moving from a niche early adopter brand to one that moves product.

We've tilted Ministry towards being in locations where its demographic actually buys things (Santa Monica place) vs locations that make a brand feel special but doesn't move product (Abbott Kinney).

As a follow-up Art sent me an unsolicited note asking to collaborate on more things. This all is happening while WithMe continues to move along but frustrate all of us. Any risk of OWM's mediocre performance has been detached from our reputation.

Following our RE meeting we spent time with Tashi, Keitsuke's guy. A lot of interesting things came out of that meeting, namely a potential meeting with the venture LP folks in the Armani Group (potential LP) and Uniqlo (same).
