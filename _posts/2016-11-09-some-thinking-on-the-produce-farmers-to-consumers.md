Some thinking on the produce / farmers to consumers market. Sent as a response to FindVeggies.

Hey man,

Sorry for my slowness.

I definitely believe the industry can be reshaped. But to be honest I haven't seen the traction in the produce-only space to warrant an investment in Find Veggies or any other company I've encountered to date.

I've come to this conclusion not because I don't believe in you but because I haven't seen any approach that fundamentally reshapes how goods move at a macro level. As you know I don't believe that the customer delivery is the business here...the ultimate winner of that market will be the company with the most vehicular volume (e.g. Uber).

So until we see an opportunity to reshape the supply chain, even if it starts out simpler, we won't be able to invest.
